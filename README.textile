JavaTrek is based on Chuck L. Peterson's MTrek.

----------------------------------------------------------

JavaTrek is a real time space combat simulator. Controlled via a keyboard through a telnet interface, you can choose from a variety of ships to battle it out for gold in a text based 3d environment.

Requirements:
Java Runtime Environment or SDK 1.6.0 or better.
MySQL database accessible from the machine running the server.

Running JavaTrek:
1. Download and install a compatible version of the Java Runtime Environment or SDK.  (See above.)
2. Create your MySQL/PostgreSQL database and note it's server, username, password and database name.
3. Execute the appropriate jtrek_tables.sql-xxxxxxx file inside the database so that the table structure is created.
4. Make a copy of "jtrek.properties.blank" and name it "jtrek.properties".  Update the jdbc.driver, jdbc.url, jdbc.user and jdbc.password fields.  Save the file.

WINDOWS:
Ensure that the bin/ folder in your Java JRE is in your system path.
Double click on the "runJTrekWindows.bat" file to start your server.

LINUX:
Ensure that the java binary is in your path.
Make sure "startup.sh" is executable.  When completed, execute "./startup.sh" in the directory that you extracted JavaTrek to.
* We've found that running JavaTrek in a screen is best.  For more information on the screen command, refer to your distro documentation.

OPTIONAL:
Edit the welcome.txt file to change what a user sees when they connect to your server.

GETTING BOTS RUNNING:
The bots use a separate player account.
Log into JavaTrek and create an account with a dummy ship.  Then quit the game. eg. "BotAccount" or similar.
Switch to the server console and type "show playerids".  This command will list player id numbers and player accounts in the database.  Make a note of which player id is for your bot account.
Open the "jtrek.properties" file and edit the bot.playerId entry by change the value to the specific account number.  eg. If the id was 5, then the line should read bot.playerId=5.
Ensure that the respawn time is correct.
Ensure that bot.maxBots has the correct number of bots that you wish to run.
Switch to the server console and type "shutdown".
Restart the server by executing the bat file or script.

CREATING A Q SHIP:
Q ships are the "administrative" ships of the game.  Basically indestructable.  Powerful weapons.  Infinite cloak.
Change the field "ship_class" in the "ships" table of one of your existing ships to "Q".
  eg. Execute this query in your database: UPDATE ships SET ship_class="Q" WHERE ship_name="Burninator";
If you saved off a non-cloaking ship, you may want to set ship_cloak = true while you're at it.
